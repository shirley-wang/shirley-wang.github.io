# Foodie

Foodie is a web application that allows customers to put a price on their food orders. Customers make their orders by filling in their own desired price, maximum wait time, and further options for gluten free and vegan meals. After the order is made, restaurants will then respond back with their best offers for orders they are willing to entertain. Once return offers are finalized by the restaurants, notifications are sent back to the customers with all the different restaurant offers including any other options the restaurants have for the customer. Once the customer has decided on which offer they would like to take, they then proceed with the transaction. The food will be delivered after the restaurant has received the finalized order.
